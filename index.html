    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        With 13 years of experience in the IT industry, I’ve journeyed through various technical roles, starting as an apprentice and advancing through help desk and on-site support. Over time, I moved into infrastructure and systems management, eventually transitioning into project delivery and management. Today, I serve as a Security Manager, leading our 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) team, which I had the privilege of building from the ground up. I’ve designed and implemented all policies, workflows, and standards for the team, ensuring smooth operations and consistent performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout my career, I’ve developed and integrated numerous monitoring solutions across customer environments, linking them seamlessly with tools like Microsoft 365. In my current role, I continue to focus on automation, leveraging PowerShell to streamline and optimize tasks for my team, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve successfully managed and delivered large-scale projects for notable clients, including London Array, North Air, SGN, Prada, and FM Conway, ensuring each project was completed to the highest standard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of work, I am an avid tabletop wargamer and a passionate painter and modeller. I enjoy creating 3D models using Blender and frequently handle print requests from my local game store community.
